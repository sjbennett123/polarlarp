    Duration: 5 Minutes
    description: This spell makes the victim view the caster as his or her best friend in the whole world. While this spell is in effect, no amount of logic or role-playing will convince the victim that he or she has been Charmed, and the victim will not remember the casting of the spell until after it has worn off or been cured. An attack on the victim by the caster’s party will not immediately break the spell, but if the caster cannot come up with a good reason why he or she is not helping to defend the victim, then that will. If the caster attacks the victim, then the spell is broken immediately. A victim of this spell will not do anything completely against his or her own nature (such as attack his or her own party) unless a very good reason can be given by the caster. The spell does not turn the victim into a mindless robot blindly following orders, but it does require the victim to stay by the side of the new “friend” and listen to his or her suggestions.” (Note that this assumes that they both speak the same language. You cannot obey a “suggestion” that you don’t understand.) This spell only works on creatures that have a mind as defined by the game. Several creatures (such as lesser undead, golems, or some giant insects) do not have a mind that can be affected by this spell. After the spell’s duration expires, the victim remembers everything that happened except the actual casting of the Charm spell. Depending upon the circumstances,the victim might sometimes realize that he or she had been charmed. Note that this spell is not strong enough to override Control Undead, Fear, Enslavement or Vampire Charm Table 5-6 on page 64.

The caster must place an individually recognizable styled “H” in the center of the circle as if it were a hearth indicating it is active, the “H” is OOG the way a “W” is for a ward. The circle remains active even if the caster leaves it but if dispelled or otherwise disrupted the “H” must be removed. A player must confrm their “H” is still present before using a circle of harmony. A player may cast this spell from both schools of magic in order to have the eﬀect of the hearth for both schools. If they do this the “H” must reﬂect this to them. Multiple characters can have this eﬀect active on the same area, but each circle of harmony must have its own “H” which must be recognizable by the player who cast it and distinct from any others.

This effect is stronger than calm, Calm animal, Charm, Charm Animal, Shun, Shun Animal or Fear.

No effect not on this list may be transferred using Empathic Healing. The caster cannot use spell protectives or combat abilities like Dodg e or Phase to negate the effect upon them. If the effect is not inflicted upon the caster because of immunity to the effect, a formal magic defense, or a magical item, then the spell fails. The caster must take the effect or use a racial resist for the spell to succeed. The caster must begin the duration of the negative effect they take upon themselves from the point they take the effect not when it was originally cast on the one they removed it from.

The victim cannot move, speak, touch-cast, Gadabari Hex, or perform any game skills requiring movement. The spell lasts for ten minutes, but may be dropped by the caster at any time if he or she touches the victim and states “Imprison down.” This statement is out of-game, and can be used even if the caster is Silenced or inside the Imprison. Any observers who hear the statement are aware that the Imprison was dropped, and they might know who dropped it. A Dispel Magic will bring down the Imprison, but will not dispel any other spell effects on the creature inside. Any creature sealed within an Imprison spell cannot be affected by any effect or damage, nor can they be moved. A victim of the Imprison is completely aware of his or her surroundings and unless unconscious or otherwise impaired will remember all that occurred while Imprisoned. This spell will prevent the victim from being searched and only the caster may deliver a Killing Blow to the recipient with the phrase “Imprison Down” after the three count. If the Killing Blow fails (for example, if the creature inside is immune to the caster’s attack), then the Imprison will drop as soon as the Killing Blow is completed and the creature may then defend itself.

This spell will not work on an unshatterable item or a magically protected item. Shattering an item that has other items within or fastened to it will destroy all of the items. This spell will shatter not only a shield but also any scrolls attached to the back. Shattering a box or door will set off any traps present as well as the items within. After the item is shattered the prop for the item remains, but is unusable.

    Potion: Yes
    Manifold: Yes
    Duration: 5 Minutes
    description: This spell causes the victim to feel great discomfort around the caster. The victim will not attack the caster, and will immediately move at least 10 feet away from the caster and stay at least that far away while the spell is in effect. If the victim is within the 10 feet when the spell is cast, the victim must move away, but never in a manner that will endanger the victim or cause direct harm to them. In other words, they cannot be made to jump off a cliff or walk towards a magical rift or do any other action which would cause harm (much like a Charm spell cannot force the victim to take self-destructive actions). This spell does not create a 10 foot magical circle around the caster which is effective only upon the vic tim; if the victim has to come closer than ten feet in order to get away (say for example, to pass close to the caster in order to get to an exit), then that is permissible. While within that 10 foot area however, the victim can take no in-game actions against the caster. If the caster attacks the target, the Shun ends immediately. This spell is a type of charm and can be resisted with the racial ability Resist Charm, and it can be cured with an Aw aken spell or Dispel Magic spell. Stronger charms such as Vampire Charm or Enslavement will override its effects. See Table 5-6 on page 64.

    description: The victim of this spell cannot talk and cannot cast any spell. The victim must still call out the damage points his or her weapons do if combat ensues while the spell is in effect, as well as any out-of-game “trigger” phrases such as “Reflect Magic” or “Parry.” The silence can be removed by either Aw aken or Dispel Magic. This is not a charm spell and thus it cannot be resisted by those with the Resist Charm ability.

This spell can be cast on a target multiple times but they must have five minutes or less left on their death count or it will not work and the spell will be lost. Tarry cannot extend a death count past the time of reset and if it has already extended the count past the initial five minutes when reset occurs the effect will end and the character will go to resurrect. This spell can never be used to allow the target to receive a life spell gained in the next reset period if the initial death count expired during the previous reset period. It can never be used to force a character to take multiple castings of the obliterate formal. At any point past the initial five minute death count the target may chose to end their count and r esurrect immediately, a spirit may not be held for longer than their initial five minutes using a tarry against their will even if enslaved or controlled in any other manner.

The names of the people Invested must be written in the room’s marshal notes.

The building must be visibly marked to indicate the presence of Ward by placing a large “W” on the door.

The victim may not walk, run, or be moved in any way. Any item the victim is holding cannot be dropped. However, since the effect allows the victim to be searched, anyone else can choose to physically remove a hand-held item from the victim simply by searching” them. Even a victim with Superhuman Strength cannot prevent himself from being “searched” in this manner. This spell does not prevent the victim from being searched or being given a Killing Blow.

    description: This spell causes the target’s limb to become aged and infirm. The limb may be specified by the caster (right or left leg or arm). You can have up to four Wither Limb spells upon you at a time. No weapon may be wielded by that limb nor may the limb be used for locomotion or spell casting. If a leg is withered you must kneel down (unless you can’t due to a medical reason), you may not hop on the remaining leg. Only an arm or leg can be thus withered. Tentacles or similar appendages are considered arms for this purpose. The head, tongue, or any other such organ do not count as limbs. A Dispel Magic will remove all active Wither Limb spells. If the caster does not specify, or if the spell is received from a Potion or carrier attack, then it is the target’s choice as to which currently un-withered limb becomes withered. If all your limbs are withered, call “got it.” See "Stacked Effects" on page 47.
