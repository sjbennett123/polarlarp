cantrips:
 -  name: Armored to Magic
    full_name: Indessa’s Dweomer Barrier
    Type: Personal
    Duration: Day
    School: Both
    Cost: 0
    Incantation: I grant myself armor to <spelltype>
    oog_notes: The caster must call <Type> Shield when the effect is triggered
    Effect: >
      The caster gains a dumb magic shield which may go under their normal protectives and will protect them from the first spell of a given type which hits them. A shield magic or reflect magic will come into play before an Armored to Magic does. The types are based upon the casters school and are as follows...
      
      
      Earth... Gift, Curse, Mystic Force, Chaos, Earth, Command, and Summoned Force. 
      
      
      Celestial... I Call Forth, Mystic Force, Imprison, Command, and Summoned Force.
      
      
      The Armored to Magic will be triggered by any spell (incanted, spellstrike, or magic; but NOT arcane, physical, or elemental) which has the above word in its incant.
      
      
      Only one Armored to Magic may be in effect at a given time. Armored to Magic is lost if caster dies and requires a life spell. A new casting of Armored to Magic will replace an old casting of it.
 -  name: Carrier Immunity
    full_name: Karvecki's Protection From Dweomered Claws
    Type: Personal
    Duration: Invoked
    School: Both
    Cost: 1
    Incantation: I grant myself carrier immunity to <effect>
    oog_notes: The caster must call “I Invoke Carrier Immunity <carrier type> against you” to the opponent to activate it and then call no effect <carrier type> when struck.
    Effect: >
      The formal caster who uses a carrier immunity may declare one carrier type from which they may invoke a limited immunity where they choose to not take any extra effect other than damage. The type of carrier attack is chosen at the time of the casting of this cantrip and may not be changed except by the casting of a second carrier immunity which removes the first. For example a formal caster who runs into a pack of Yellowjackets swinging paralyze and has cast Carrier Immunity <Paralysis> may choose to become immune to the carrier attack paralyze of a particular yellowjacket attacking him. To become immune to a second yellowjacket attacking him he would have to invoke a second use from the casting. If the caster suddenly comes face to face with a creature swinging wither they would have to cast a brand new carrier immunity to wither before they could use the immunity and they would lose all remaining charges of the carrier immunity to paralysis.
      
      
      The following are not considered carrier attacks for the purpose of this cantrip... Magic, Silver, Flame, Ice, Lightning, Stone, and Normal.
      
      
      Only one Carrier Immunity may be in effect at a given time. Carrier Immunity is lost if caster dies and requires a life spell. A second casting of Carrier Immunity will replace an old casting of it.

    full_name: Erol's Mnemonic Spellstrike
    Type: Personal
    Duration: Day
    School: Both

    Incantation: I grant myself the ability of channeling
    oog_notes: The caster must say the full incant of the spell being channeled and then strike the target with their weapon while calling spellstrike <Name of spell just incanted> <Option for spell just incanted>.
    Effect: >
      Allows two spells from the memory of the formal caster to be delivered as a spellstrike. The spells must be of a level less than or equal to the number of levels the caster has of the appropriate school of formal magic and must be of the same school as the channeling cantrip which was cast. Thus a caster with nine levels of formal magic earth could spellstrike any earth spell by casting channeling. A caster with seven levels of formal magic earth could spellstrike any seventh level or lower earth spell by casting channeling. Neither of these casters can use an earth channeling cantrip to spellstrike a celestial spell. The caster chooses when to use these spellstrikes. Only one Channeling may be in effect at a given time. Channeling is lost if caster dies and requires a life spell.

      The conditions for earth magic are Charmed, Cursed, Death, Magically Bound (Pin, Bind, Web, Confine), Paralyzed, Poisoned, Silenced, Sleeping, or Unconsciousness. 
      
      
      The conditions for celestial magic are Charmed, Imprisoned, Magically Bound (Pin, Bind, Web, Confine), Silenced, Sleeping, or Unconsciousness. 
      
      
      The contingent spell is triggered as soon as the caster enters the triggering state and may neither be stopped by anything nor may the caster choose not to invoke the contingency. A new casting of contingency will replace an old casting of it. Contingency is lost if the caster resurrects. The contingent spell will still trigger a shield magic, the caster may chose to accept the spell if he is in a state capable of accepting a spell.

    Incantation: I enchant you with a <Spell Name> spell imbued from my knowledge
    oog_notes: The caster should give the recipient both a cantrip tag indicating the imbue and the spell tag for the spell that was imbued.
    Effect: >

The spell must be of a level less than or equal to the number of levels the caster has of the appropriate school of formal magic and must be of the same school as the magic deliverance cantrip which was cast. Thus a caster with nine levels of formal magic earth could cast as magic any earth spell by casting magic deliverance. A caster with seven levels of formal magic earth could cast as magic any seventh level or lower earth spell by casting magic deliverance. Neither of these casters can use an earth magic deliverance cantrip to cast a celestial spell as magic. The caster chooses when to deliver this spell as magic. Only one magic deliverance may be in effect at any given time. As per the rules for delivering a spell as magic the caster must be able to speak but need not have use of their arms as “Magic” is an innate ability.

    Effect: >
      The caster may place a spirit mark of up to 4" by 4" and any two colors upon a target person with a spirit. The caster decides what the spirit mark looks like and where it is. The spirit mark will appear on any body the spirit, which has been marked, is within, it will appear in an equivalent place to where it was originally placed.

    Effect: >

    oog_notes: To use this cantrip a caster must carry life stones with them and have the bag and draw witnessed by a marshal for later reporting. A hold may not be called for this. Any field resurrection must be reported to those responsible for tracking resurrection as soon as possible following the casting of the cantrip. The marshal is required to inform the target of the cantrip that they do not have to resurrect and if they do they return immediately at one body.
    Effect: >
      Field resurrection allows a single spirit to be resurrected directly in front of the caster, without the need for a circle. This occurs in the time it takes to cast this cantrip with the target if the cantrip resurrecting at only one body. In all other ways this resurrection is identical to a normal resurrection. A spirit may refuse to resurrect when called to a field resurrection, instead seeking to resurrect as normal. If this happens the cantrip is wasted and may not be redirected to another spirit. The caster must be aware that a spirit has just left to resurrect in the area, they gain no special sense for spirits. A spirit seeking resurrection will feel the call of a field resurrection as if it were an earth circle.
      
      
      Field abjuration will prevent a spirit in need of resurrection from being able to be resurrected using the field resurrection cantrip but will in no other way affect the resurrection of a spirit.
      
      
      The caster must be within 10’ of the spirit to be field resurrected or field abjured at the time of casting of this cantrip.

The effect is lost if the caster dies and needs a life spell. Defiling pool is a pool of elemental chaos with the same limits as the healing pool. A caster may have both a healing pool and a defiling pool at the same time but not more than one of each. If the caster takes body damage during the call of “10 elemental healing” or “10 elemental chaos”, that 10 point casting fails and is lost to the pool but the rest of the pool remains.

    Effect: >
        Replenish will bring a 10’ by 10’ area per level of earth formal magic of the caster more in line with the natural progression in the area. This will undo the effects of corruption and chaos upon the land in slow increments.
        
        
        Corruption will cause an area to become more out of line with the natural flow in an area, impassible thorns and brambles may grow, fertile areas may become swamp like, pools of chaos will become more likely to develop.
