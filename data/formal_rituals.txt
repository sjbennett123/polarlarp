Level 7
Target Spirit
Duration: Instantaneous
Components: P7, C1, E2, S3, V1 (all Unrestricted)
This formal magic changes the target from the current race to a diﬀerent race, chosen by the target.
The new race must be from the list of allowable PC races in the current version of the NERO rules.
The target will be immediately aware of the race chosen by the caster when this formal magic
begins. It will not change the basic appearance of the target, except for the specifc racial alterations.
Therefore, the target is still recognizable to any who would recognize the target if the target hadn’t
changed race.
Any Racial Skills pertaining to the previous race of the person are lost, but the build is kept and
turned into “Free Build”. The target retains any non-racial skills that are more difcult for the new
race to learn, and they must pay the higher cost. If the target does not have enough free build to
retain these skills, the target may “forget” these skills in any order it chooses until it has enough free
build to cover any increased costs.
If the new race cannot be the same profession as the previous race, then this formal magic will fail.
All components and scrolls used in the casting of this formal magic MUST be of unrestricted
transfer.

components normally required for this formal magic.
The caster must state the words, “I atune this <target> to the spell <spell name>” and then the spell
must be cast from the caster’s memory at the end of the formal magic.
Channel cannot be used for 9th level spells or confning eﬀects (pin, binD, web, anD conFine).
The proper call for a channeled spell is “Spellstrike <full spellname> <option/number>” (Option/
Number is for when the spells allows for a choice such as wither liMb- i.e., right arm or shatter-i.e.,
shield, or if the spell has an associated number such as cure light wounDs)
The spell to be channeled must come from the user’s memory. The caster’s hand need not be empty
but may only be holding the weapon that will channel the spell. When the verbal is complete the

ability to cast the spell once, following the rules for Activating Magic Items. If the spell in question is
reversible, only one version is placed within the target at the time of original enchantment. If the spell
is elDritch blast then one element must be chosen at time of enchantment.
The tag should be marked accordingly when the enchant is cast. If completely expended, it should
be rendered useless and turned into Logistics for return to the chapter of origin for tracking purposes.

Glyph of Protection
Level 1
Target One doorway
Duration: 5 Days
Components: P1, C1, E1, + <designated by the type of glyph>
This formal magic will create a visible marking on both sides of the target and place one batle magic
spell of the appropriate school (or an Alarm eﬀect) onto the target. The marking must be at least 6” x
6” and cannot be covered by any means.
If a frst, second, or third level spell, or the alarM eﬀect is used, add an additional point of Power.
If a fourth, ffth, or sixth level spell is used, add two points of Power. If a seventh or eighth level spell
is used, add three points of Power. Ninth level spells cannot be used.
The following spells can be used in a glyph oF protection: binD, cause Disease, conFine, curse,
Destroy unDeaD, Dragon’s breath, FlaMe bolt, harM unDeaD, ice bolt, ice storM, lightning bolt,
lightning storM, Magic Missile, paralyze, pin, repel, shun, silence, sleep, stone bolt, taint blooD,
trap unDeaD, weakness, web, anD wither liMb. Any of the “Cause” or “Cure” wounds spells can also
be used.
The spell must be cast from the caster’s memory (or a message up to twenty words in length must
be spoken) at the end of the formal magic. The caster draws the symbol and all creatures within the
Circle receive a link to the glyph.
Any person (with enough spirit to be aﬀected by spells) who passes through the doorway must
be invested to the Glyph of Protection or recognized by someone who is invested to the Glyph of
Protection. Otherwise the Glyph will activate its selected eﬀect. The Glyph instantaneously resets for
each breaking of the plane throughout the duration of this formal magic. This means that multiple
persons breaking the plane at the same time will each be aﬀected as if they were breaking the plane
in sequence. The eﬀect of a Glyph of Protection may not be DoDgeD or phaseD but may be resisteD if
applicable.
Casting Detect Magic upon the Glyph will reveal that it is a magical glyph and specify the casting’s
school of magic, but it does not provide any other information. Casting Dispel Magic upon the
doorway will deactivate the glyph allowing passage through the plane of the doorway. The Glyph
will remain deactivated as long as the caster of the Dispel Magic maintains line of sight on it. Once41
the spell caster loses line of sight or is himself/herself aﬀected by Dispel Magic, the Glyph will reset
and trigger the next time someone breaks the plane. A Dispel Magic cast upon the glyph will also
break any line of sight eﬀects currently active due to the Glyph of Protection.
No mater what the eﬀect of the Glyph of Protection no creature passing through the portal the
glyph is upon may be healed by the functioning of the Glyph.
Each portal may only have one Glyph of Protection upon it. Multiple Glyphs of Protection on a
single structure must be at least fve feet apart.
A person may be invested in the Glyph of Protection by use of the investiture formal magic of the
school of magic to which the Glyph of Protection belongs.
All Glyphs of Protection that duplicate a spell are as per the description in the NERO rulebook.
The Glyph itself is considered the caster of the spell. Any area with a Glyph of Protection must be
marked to indicate a marshal is needed to enter it.
A Marshal’s Note must accompany each Glyph of Protection, listing the type of glyph, the
expiration date, and the invested members (IG and OOG names).

Interplanar Conduit
Level 5
Target Spirit and Being with a Spirit (on the scroll-specifed plane)
Duration: 5 minutes per level of Primary caster’s Celestial Formal Magic Ability, non-extendable
Components: P5, C2, S3, V1, and an additional P1 for each additional person in the communication
Approved
Planes:
Air, Earth, Fire, Water
This formal magic will allow two-way communication between a target spirit (which can be the
caster) and a being with a spirit on the scroll-specifed plane.
The caster or target must either personally know the being to be communicated with or have
knowledge of its true name or communing name. The being communicated with may refuse contact
and may cut oﬀ the communication at any point. The caster or target of the formal magic may also
terminate communications at any point.
Communication will be verbal only and the communication from the other plane may be heard by
all of the casters and the target. Only the being to be communicated with may hear the communication from the plane of casting. Anyone within hearing distance may hear the half of the conversation
on their plane.
This formal magic may not be used to communicate with someone on the same plane as the caster.
If the caster, the target, or the being to be communicated with leaves the plane they were on when the
formal magic began then the formal magic will terminate. If the being to be communicated with is
not on the scroll-specifed plane the formal magic will fail. If the caster or target leaves the circle then
the formal magic will terminate.
Plot must be notifed at least 1 hour in advance of the casting of this formal magic. This formal
magic may not be used to communicate with PCs who are not present at the event at which the
formal magic is cast. Communication with a PC from another chapter who is on another plane due to
actions outside of this chapter must be approved in advance with the staﬀ/plot commitee of the other

Interplanar Travel
Level 8
Target Spirit(s)
Duration: Variable
Components: P8, S4, V4, + P equivalent to the # of willing people travelling
Approved
Planes
Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Order, Chaos, Dream, Reason, Life, Death, Darkness, Light
This formal magic causes a willing person, if that person has a spirit, to travel to the specifed plane.
All possessions on the person who is the target of the formal magic will travel with the spirit. Once
this formal magic has begun, the spirit is unable to leave the circle until the formal magic is complete.
The caster may decide upon a time limit of fewer than fve days during the casting of this formal
magic. The only allowable increments are in days or hours. Circumstances may dictate that this time
limit will vary (plot may decide the duration of the formal magic).43
Should the target die while on the other plane, the spirit will return to its plane of origin to
resurrect. may or may not be the plane from which the target originally travelled. Another
interplanar travel formal magic could be cast to send the target back to the plane on which the
original Interplanar Travel formal magic was cast on. Other than by death or further formal magic
use the only way to return to the plane of origin is to wait for the variable duration of this formal
magic to expire.
This formal magic guarantees the basic ability to survive on a hostile plane for 5 days. This
means that the target can breathe and perform necessary functions for continued existence while
on the plane. For example, the target may breathe even though on the plane of water and the ﬂame
that makes up the elemental plane of fre will not burn him/her to death. This does not give any
immunity to atacks based on the same principle; in the above example on the elemental plane of fre
even though the targetis not consumed in the inferno, he/she may would be damaged by elemental
fre atacks.
This formal magic may allow travel for any number of willing targets up to one half the total levels
of Celestial formal magic of the casters, in the appropriate school (round up).
This formal magic in no way targets the traveling person to a particular area of the specifed
plane. On occasion an additional base item for the casting of this formal magic may be found which
will cause the formal to target a specifc area of the specifed plane, but this item will generally
be consumed in the casting regardless of the success of the formal magic. A subsequent casting
of Interplanar Travel to a plane the targets departed in the past 5 days will result in the targets
appearing at the original point of departure in that plane.
This formal magic lasts until the target suﬀers a death or the variable time limit expires.
Investiture / Divestiture
Level 1
Target Spirit and a Circle of Power, Glyph of Protection or Greater Ward
Duration: For the duration of the second target
Components: Invest - P1, C1, S1, T1
Divest - P1, D1, S1, V1
This formal magic will create or destroy a link between two targets. If used as investiture, this
formal magic creates a link between the two targets. If used as Divestiture, this formal magic
destroys one of the links, if any exist, between the two targets.
The caster must already have an Investiture that links him/her to the second target.
The school of this scroll must be the same as the school of the second target.
Note this is one scroll usable as both Invest and Divest.
Investiture follows the rules as described in the Nero® 9th Edition Rulebook under the topic of
Extended Circles of Power on page 50.44
Magic Aura
Level 2
Target Weapon
Duration: 5 days
Components: P2, C1, D1, E1
This formal magic will create a magical Damage Aura on a weapon. However, no additional bonus
is added to the damage call of the weapon. This allows the wielder of the weapon to use the Weapon
Type “Magic” when desired. If this formal magic is cast upon a weapon with a DaMage aura already
present, there is no additional eﬀect.
Mend Golem
Level 3
Target Golem
Duration: Instantaneous
Components: P3, C2, E2
This formal magic will heal a golem for ten points of damage for every level of celestial formal magic
possessed by the caster. The healing may be split among multiple golems. This formal magic will

Once this formal magic has begun, the spirit is unable to leave the circle until the formal magic is
complete.
The spirit’s death bag is modifed by this formal magic to have been weakened by two deaths. In
addition, this formal magic causes a third death. Upon resurrection, the spirit must pull from death’s
bag only once, with the spirit having been weakened by this formal magic by a total of three deaths.
The target may not refuse this formal magic.
Casting of this formal magic is always considered in Dark Territory.
After the Formal Magic is complete, the victim is still able to receive a liFe spell for the next fve
minutes, and only one spell is necessary to restore the creature to one body point. If a Life spell is
received, the creature is not forced to resurrect at all, takes no deaths as a result of the obliterate, and
their death bag returns to normal.
All components and scrolls used in the casting of this formal magic MUST be of unrestricted transfer.45
A creature that has been Obliterated but has not yet resurrected or received a life spell will not
suﬀer any additional deaths or have their death bag further modifed as a result of subsequent
castings of Obliterate. The target of an Obliterate formal magic may not be simultaneously targeted
by another formal magic.
Planar Asylum
Level 1
Target Spirit
Duration: 5 Days, may not be extended
Components: P1, C1, E1, +1 P per additional person in the Asylum
Approved
Planes:
Air, Earth, Fire, Water
This formal magic will allow the targets to survive on the scroll-specifed plane even though its
natural environment might be fatal to the targets. This formal magic does not confer any special
resistance to atacks similar to the nature of the plane (e.g., planar asyluM - eleMental plane oF Fire
does not grant immunity to fre based atacks).
This formal magic may protect one person per level of formal magic ability of the caster (in the
appropriate school).
Planar Gate
Level 9
Target None
Duration: 10 Minutes per level of celestial formal magic of the casters, not extendable.
Components: P9, C4, E2, S2, V4
Approved
Planes:
Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Order, Chaos, Dream, Reason, Life, Death, Darkness, Light
This formal magic will cause a 10’ x 10’ gate to open between the area cast upon and a random area
on the specifed plane. The gate will allow passage in both directions but confers no ability to survive
a hostile environment in the plane. The gate will remain open for 10 minutes per level of celestial
formal magic possessed by the casters of this formal magic.
On occasion items may be found which can serve to target the other end of the gate to a particular
location. Any spirit that travels through the gate and dies on the other side will automatically shift
back to their plane of origin to resurrect; this may or may not be the plane from which he/she entered
the gate. This shift upon death occurs whether or not the gate is still open.
A person may not be on both sides of the gate - as soon as they break the plane of the gate on one
side they shift across to the other side. From one side of the gate to the other; combat is impossible;
vision is limited and often completely impossible.
A physical representation for the gate must be supplied by the formal magic caster; the physical
representation must delineate the sides of the gate.
Plot should be notifed in advance of the casting of this formal magic so that they may be properly
prepared.46
Protection Aura
Level 5
Target Spirit
Duration: 5 days
Components: P5, C2, D1, E1, V2 (Unrestricted components only)
This formal magic will provide a protection aura 2. If multiple Protection Auras are cast, they will
provide protection in a pyramid fashion. An additional two castings will provide a Protection Aura
3, an additional three castings (for a total of six castings) will provide a Protection Aura 4, and an
additional four castings (for a total of ten castings, the maximum) will provide a Protection Aura 5.
Any damage up to the value of the Protection Aura will be decreased to one point of damage. (For
example, a weapon blow of 2 against a single protection aura will be reduced to 1 point of damage
but a blow of 3 will do a full 3 points.) Protection Aura falls outside all armor and protectives except
Magic arMor.
Protection Aura is not cumulative with other Protection Auras nor is it cumulative with the
monster ability thresholD.
Protection Aura does not provide any protection from carrier atacks. For example, a carrier atack
of “2 Normal Taint Blood” against a single protection aura will do 1 point of damage, and if the
person is taking body damage then the person is aﬀected by the taint blooD eﬀect.
All components and scrolls used in the casting of this formal magic MUST be of unrestricted
transfer.
The level of the pyramid (Protection Aura 2=1, Protection Aura 3=2, Protection Aura 4=3, Protection
Aura 5=4) is the number of eﬀects with regard to the 5-eﬀect limit, rather than the number of castings.
Render Indestructible
Level 2
Target Item
Duration: 5 days
Components: P2, C2, E2, T1
This formal magic will render the target inDestructible, which prevents an item from being aﬀected
by normal destructive means such as shatter and Destroy spells or normal physical damage
including traps.
This formal magic may only be cast upon a weapon, shield, armor, pouch, door, or any other item
up to a normal door in size. If cast upon a suit of armor, the armor will be immune to the Destroy
eﬀect but may still be reduced to zero points via normal combat damage.47
Spell Store
Level 4
Target Item or Spirit
Duration: 5 Days
Components: P4, C2, E1
This formal magic will create a rechargeable Batle Magic spell slot of the appropriate school in the
target.
The frst casting will allow storage of a frst, second or third level Batle Magic spell from a magic
user’s memory only. Each additional casting in a pyramid fashion will allow up to three additional
levels for the spell slot. Thus after an additional two castings, up to six spell levels may be stored
within the target. After an additional three castings (for a total of six) up to nine levels may be stored
within the target. Six castings is the maximum per school of magic on a single item. Once the item or
person is charged, anyone in possession of the item or the person into which the Spell Store was cast
may cast the spells stored within as if they were casting from a magic item. The spells stored can be
of any combination of levels up to the maximum spell levels allowed by the formal magic performed.
Thus a sixth level spell store item or person could hold a sixth level spell or six frst level spells. If
the spell in question is reversible, only one version is placed within the target at the time of original
enchantment. If the spell is elDritch blast then one element must be chosen at time of enchantment.
To charge the item or person it must be touched by the individual casting the spells with which it
is to be charged. Upon the casting of the spell into the item or person, the possessor of the item or the
person must announce “Absorbed”.
A spell store item or person may not intercept a thrown spell and absorb it in any circumstances.
A Spell Store item always discharges at the end of an event and always begins an event empty. The
spells within do not remain from event to event and may not transfer between chapters.
The level of the pyramid (1-3 spell level=1, 4-6 spell levels=2, 7-9 spell levels=3) is the number of
eﬀects with regard to the 5-eﬀect limit, rather than the number of castings.
Spirit Farewell
Level 1
Target Permanently Dead Spirit
Duration: Ten Minutes per formal magic level of the caster or until the spirit chooses to leave,
whichever is frst.
Components: P1, C1, S1, V1
This formal magic provides a fnal farewell to a spirit that did not survive resurrection.
When the formal magic begins, the caster must state the name of a creature that has permanently
died. If possible a personal possession, someone close to the deceased during its life, or even a
writen work describing the deceased should also be present in the circle, although it is not required.
The formal magic must be performed within one month from the death of the spirit per level of
formal magic possessed by the caster(s). The spirit must be willing to return and may choose to
ignore the casting of this formal magic if desired. This formal magic can be cast more than once for a
given creature so long as it is within the specifed time limit.48
Upon successful casting, the spirit will appear in the circle (use a three count), but is restricted to
the confnes of the circle used for the formal magic. The spirit will forget every detail of the last hour
before its death. Similarly, a spirit has no knowledge of any events since its death (except for other
visits via spirit Farewell or contact ancient DeaD). Note that no other formal magic can be cast on
the spirit during its return.
The duration of this formal magic may not be extended by any means.
Before the formal magic begins the proper NPC or PC who used to play the part should be present.
If the proper player is not present on site at the time of casting, this formal magic will automatically
fail. If the spirit named has not permanently died, this formal magic will automatically fail. At the
discretion of the local chapter, a diﬀerent NPC can be substituted if the proper one is not available.
Also at their discretion, “events” may be substituted for “months” to compensate for long times
between events.
At the conclusion of the formal magic casting, the caster(s) will be aware if the spirit chose to ignore
the casting.
The recalled spirit may not use any game skills. It appears as it did in life, but is non-corporeal and
immune to all game eﬀects.
Spirit Forge
Level 5
Target Spirit
Duration: Instantaneous
Components: P5, C1, S2, V1 (Unrestricted components only)
This formal magic tears the target spirit apart and forges it anew. The spirit forgets its previous
profession and all skills but may choose a new profession and relearn skills immediately.
spirit Forge is instantaneous and irrevocable.
The player may immediately reenter their character with identical experience and any changes
to the class and skills in the character database. The formal magic marshal must enter the date of
the Spirit Forge in the Formal Magic logbook for entry into the character database at the earliest
convenience. Deaths taken from this formal magic may NEVER be bought back with goblin stamps
in any chapter..
The process of Spirit Forge (from any source) may weaken the spirit. If the process of Spirit Forge
is performed upon the same spirit more than once within a year it will be weakened each time by a
number of deaths equal to the number of times it has spirit forged other than the frst. For this reason
the date of each Spirit Forge eﬀect must be listed on the player’s character card.
For example, this is listed on Lum’s character card
October 12 1999, Spirit Forge (frst ever)
October 13 1999, Spirit Forge (one death)
October 11 2000, Spirit Forge (two deaths)
October 13 2000, Spirit Forge (one death)
October 13 2001, Spirit Forge (no death)49
Spirit Link
Level 6
Target Spirit and Item
Duration: 5 days
Components: P6, C3, E2, S3
This formal magic creates a link between the targets. The targets must both be in physical contact
with the caster during the entire casting of the formal magic. The item must be considered a
possession of the target spirit and must be movable by that spirit when in their normal body.
While the item is linked, it cannot be separated from the person until the duration of the spirit link
expires or the person’s spirit suﬀers a fnal death. While the spirit is separated from the body, the
item is intangible and invisible and will reform at the place of the spirit’s resurrection. If the spirit’s
resurrection fails, the item is reformed with the dead body and then becomes the possession of and
spirit linked to the next person to pick it up as a possession, if that person has a spirit. If that person
is at the limit of the formal magics on their spirit they will realize that the item atempted to spirit link
to them and failed.
Spirit Lock
Level 9
Target Spirit and Item
Duration: 5 days
Components: P9, C4, E4, S6
This formal magic creates a link between the targets. The targets must both be in physical contact
with the caster during the entire casting of the formal magic. The item must be considered a
possession of the target spirit and must be movable by that spirit when in their normal body.
While the item is linked, it cannot be separated from the person until the duration of the spirit
lock expires. While the spirit is separated from the body the item is intangible and invisible and
will reform at the place of the spirit’s resurrection. If the spirit’s resurrection fails then the item’s
existence becomes unraveled and the item disappears forever.
All properties given to the item via formal magic will only work for the person to whom it is Spirit
Locked.
If either target is later the subject of Destroy Magic that successfully aﬀects the Spirit Lock,
all formal magic of all schools present upon the item expires immediately and the entire item is
destroyed. The intent is that there is no way for anyone to take a Spirit-Locked item from a person.50
Spirit Walk
Level 8
Target Spirit(s)
Duration: Indeterminate
School: Celestial or Earth (scroll must be marked as one or the other)
Components: P8, C1, S2, V2, + P equivalent to the total number of people Spirit Walking
This formal magic causes the targets and their possessions to travel to another circle oF power that
has a duration of longer than ten minutes. It does not provide for interplanar travel.
This formal magic may allow travel for any number of willing targets up to one half the total levels
of the casters of the formal magic (in the appropriate school).
The caster designates a person as the primary target of the formal magic. That person must know
the destination Circle of Power by having seen it himself/herself prior to the casting of this formal
magic. The destination of the spirit walk must be declared at the start of the formal magic.
Upon completion of the formal magic, all targets will go Out of Game and walk to the destination
Circle of Power. All targets walk at the pace of the slowest target. They may not pass through a
Ward. If the destination Circle of Power is inaccessible or does not exist, then if the formal magic was
also cast within a Circle of Power, that Circle of Power becomes the destination Circle of Power and
the group walks back to their origin. If that Circle of Power is also inaccessible or does not exist when
they arrive, the targets will seek resurrection and all non-spirit-linked items appear where the casting
took place. If the target(s) permanently dies, the body will likewise reform where the casting took
place.
Upon entering the destination Circle of Power, the targets and their possessions immediately begin
to reform within three slow seconds and are tangible enough to be aﬀected by atacks. The sounds of
the three-count (spoken in a normal speaking voice), as well as the sounds associated with the people
geting into the destination circle (opening doors, etc.) represent the noise of the ﬂux of their arrival.
The targets reform at the edge of the circle, just inside.
No one may Spirit Walk to or from a Circle of Power in another chapter without prior approval
from the staﬀ/plot commitees of both chapters.

feel the call and may choose to appear. If this method is used, the creature will know the identity
of the formal magic caster regardless of whether or not they choose to be summoned. If the named
creature chooses not to appear, then the caster may state another (diﬀerent) creature’s name. If the
second creature named chooses to ignore the call, a third name may be stated, and so on. If all named
creatures choose to ignore the call, or no such names are even known or tried, then a completely
random creature will appear. (The true name of a creature will probably not work outside of the
chapter where it was learned. This is left to local chapter plot discretion.)
