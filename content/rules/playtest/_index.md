Each NERO chapter abides by the rules listed in this book. Additionally, these rules can be modified and new rules added by official NERO play tests. The NERO International Office makes available an official list of rules that are being play tested on their website [www.nerolarp.com](https://www.nerolarp.com). Each chapter must make available a list of the play tests that they are using, so that players attending events at a chapter can find out ahead of time which play tests will be in use.

**These playtests are re-evaluated every 3 months.**
