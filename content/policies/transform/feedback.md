I personally think that Transforms should be a little more Unique, and a little more involved to get than just finding scrolls and comps, as you are taking on the visage of x-creature, that creature should be the one ALLOWING you the ability to do that.

I like the idea of there just being a "Transform", and thats it , and then plot/the creature can give (or take?) abilities depending on what's done for that creature (quests)..It'd be a bit more involved for plot teams, but the way it is now, someone with tons of coin can just buy their way to a 9th level transform, while others are busting their asses to get theirs.

I believe Russell mentioned it, but its a sound idea, that when your transform goes up, you're handed the card of the creature you're transforming into, or, you are given that card when you GET the transform so you can familiarize yourself with it before it goes up and arent trying to memorize a monster card in 2 min. before a field battle.

As far as repping goes, that one is a bit tougher ..I know for myself that one will take a lot of thought since I already wear a mask, and hanging another one on my belt or stuffing it into a bag isnt going to work too well. Maybe some kind of cue from plot before an encounter? Maybe if you're going to fight a master-elder-ancient-really-old vampire, your undead hunter transform is going to start coming out, and coaxing you in that direction..(IE get your rep/mask on and head to shack in x minutes ..)

Im sure I will think of more when I am more awake..lol

- Some sort of repping is encouraged.

- Paragon and Hunter are more over powered than other transforms.

 - though I took them and love them, the blanket return skill is over powered and I am sick of seeing it as much as I have overall, not just with transforms

Just some thoughts off the top of my head

\#1 Still haven't transformed...![ðŸ˜‚](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6f/2/16/1f602.png)

\#2 I think mid mod ups are very confusion, I would love it announced before or at the mod start. So players can be ready and ask questions without disrupting game flow. I think I missed my opportunity to up once due to this, once battle started I missed the call to up the transform or misunderstood it.

\#3 I feel in current state without costume requirements they are little more than stat boost. I'm totally for at least a mask requirement so its obvious who is up and who isn't.

\#4 I have always been for allowing players to up transforms once for a single mod per event. But having to decide that before the module. This gives players time to properly rep transform and face the ultimate bad guy in players ultimate form....![ðŸ¤£](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf1/2/16/1f923.png)

\#5 the amount of buyable returns seems a bit high, maybe limit it to 9 returns for 9th, 8 returns for 8th, and 7 returns for 7th.
