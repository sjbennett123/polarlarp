title: sign in sign out
---

Attention players and NPC's:

We will have a sign in/out sheet for the November event so we can keep an eye on when players leave site.

Also, we need to have a final sign out before you go home

(especially saturday night people) so it'll be a simpler checkout process with the camp.

If you don't stay until sunday morning, that's perfectly fine.

I will make sure it's on a clip board with a pen attached near the bathrooms in the main tavern/mod building area. Thank you!
