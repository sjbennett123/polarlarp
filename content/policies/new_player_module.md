title: new player module
---
mandantroy for players under 15'th level and optional for players 20'th and below. 

you can get special items on the module. 

it happens right after checkin.

designed to help all new players understand the mechanics of the game in a slow and controlled environment where they can ask questions and pause action as necessary to be safe and understand how to play the game

the mod content plot wise changes every event but they still cover all the basics of how to play the game mechanically

To my knowledge they don't get any special items. It's either a mod that flows with the content that's being ran for the event. Or a mod that focuses on  a few specific rules that may be hard to understand or that was covered a few times during game play the prior event. A few times it was a simple Q and A session.

The Q & A sessions were used when there was only a few new players, The "newbie" mods will be happening now that we have more than just a handful of new players.
