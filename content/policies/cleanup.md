Can you folks explain to me how cleanup works at POLAR? I need to write a policy for it for the website. What does the bitter end crew entail?
[10:21 AM]Dom Hurley: Sticking around til the bitter end, hitting everything that may have been missed throughout the rest of clean up and sticking around to ensure that things are better than when you left it, other than that I'd reach out to Bobby White who is the Site Marshall and he can explain clean up in more depth.
[10:22 AM]Scott Bennett: Is bobby on here?
[10:23 AM]Scott Bennett: God here comes trouble.

[10:23 AM]Chris Colland/Kael Ravenwind: Since we are an auto max chapter, mandatory cleanup is required to get your auto max
@Scott Bennett
God here comes trouble.
[10:23 AM]Chris Colland/Kael Ravenwind: Lol
[10:24 AM]Chris Colland/Kael Ravenwind: You can do packet sweeping, mopping the tavern, cleaning out PC cabins, help with NPC shack cleanup, and when meals are made Kitchen cleanup
[10:24 AM]Scott Bennett: How much cleanup does a person need to do
[10:24 AM]Scott Bennett: When they are done do they need to talk to bobby?
[10:25 AM]Scott Bennett: What happens if someone wants to leave early?
@Scott Bennett
How much cleanup does a person need to do
[10:26 AM]Chris Colland/Kael Ravenwind: I’d say about 30 minutes on average
@Scott Bennett
When they are done do they need to talk to bobby?
[10:26 AM]Chris Colland/Kael Ravenwind: Bobby has to sign their sheet or John can Bobby is busy
[10:27 AM]Ed (Shadar): I like doing packet sweeps at night before bed or before the sun rises. I bring a UV flashlight that makes most packets glow nicely.
[10:28 AM]Scott Bennett: What else is there about cleanup that I should put on the site?
[10:29 AM]Scott Bennett: What is the reward for being there for the bitter end?
@Scott Bennett
What is the reward for being there for the bitter end?
[10:29 AM]Chris Colland/Kael Ravenwind: I think it’s an extra 100-200 goblin stamps
[10:29 AM]Scott Bennett: WOW
[10:29 AM]Scott Bennett: that's a big reward!
