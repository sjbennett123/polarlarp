Journal of the Black Lord



This tome is my fourth account of the creation and maintenance of my creations.  I have coded it heavily to ensure that only those of at least minimal intelligence may read what is within.  Many of the important parts of the this account may be written in a separate code for increased security.  I believe that I am close to the end of my studies on the crystals and their uses as a catalyst.  Without access to the entire chromatic crystal, it will be impossible to replicate my creations.



The Elves have been instrumental in my studies, so it is only right to list their current assistance first.  Scouting and movement of the final test subjects have been completed.  The Gypsies were the most stubborn, yet they eventually succumbed to the experiment.  The habitats have been recreated to my exact specifications, and only the Elves know that they are not currently on the surface of Tyrra.  The mental projections created by the crystals multiple intelligences and projected by the tower itself make the areas totally lifelike.  The fools believe that I will return the Crystals to them as I have stated.  Not only that, they think that I haven't noticed the deals they have made with Reverane.  They think they are clever, but I will ensure that the army is ready for when it is needed.



Notes regarding scroll 3 – Hybrid of Half Orc and Giant – Code name Jaygermyer

This scroll is almost fully complete.  I am still attempting to integrate more of the giants strength into the Jaygermyers without making them mindless berserkers.  The giants mental capacities are just as simple as the Half Orcs, yet they lack the split second anger instinct.  The manipulation of the graveyards is complete, and will make the army more difficult to kill off for good.  I have coded the scroll to react to headware, as the creatures seem to find it interesting their usually large heads can now fit into hats and the like.  Normally the more flamboyant, the better.



Notes regarding scroll 7 – Hybrid of Biata and Efreet – Code name Buldak

This scroll is still proving to be difficult.  Retaining the mind powers of the biata and merging it with the elemental energies of an Efreet causes unstable mental functions.  The Buldak tend to burn themselves to a crisp.  I have had one promising subject in regards to this scroll which has lead me to an important discovery.  The lack of homestones in the tower caused many of the subjects alarm.  With the addition of a newly captured Biata, he was found to have a stone on him when he arrived.  I believe I will code the scroll homestones to ensure that the resulting soldiers remain mentally sound.



Notes regarding scroll 8 – Hybrid of Sarr and Glacians – Code name Einkat

Blending these creatures has proved to be rather easy despite my early thoughts.  The Sarr enjoy the reduced feelings of chill and come to enjoy it during warmer months.  The fact that these creations cannot be banished like typical outsiders will be vital to our efforts.  I only hope the Dwarven and Golgori counterparts are as easy to manipulate.  Gems will be keyed to this scroll as the Sarr mind still enjoys playing with shiny object, even if they do not show it openly.



Notes regarding scroll 4 – Hybrid of Hoblings and Unsealie Fae – Code name Slowling

It was easy to convince join the normally happy go lucky hoblings with the Unsealie fae.  The likelihood of mischievousness is a wonderful bond.  The hoblings are never in a rush to do anything, hence the name.  I am tying the scroll with mice, as the hoblings have taken on the strange side effect of eating mice.  I think the fae blood had some effect on their taste in food, as food on faerie can be very peculiar.  



I have hired a few unsuspecting townspeople to create me a laboratory on the grounds of Tyrra itself.  I am concerned with Reverane's current attitude, and am sure that a coup will take place soon.  Having this back up location will prove to make me much safer.  I have included directions on the defense systems within this journal in random locations and in different codes than my research notes.  Both the symbols and key will be different.  I am sure that Reverane will try to kill me at some point, and I will need a safe place to resurrect.  Once the scrolls are complete and linked, everything will proceed on its own.  Hopefully the forces will be ready when the void comes again.



Notes regarding scroll 5 – Hybrid of Barbarians and Couatl – Code name Culebra

The wings are out. I just can't manage to get it to work correctly.  That aside, this grouping is done and good to go.  They tend to get more aggressive as they cast due to self hatred.  I find it funny that they are stubborn enough to continue casting the nasty sky magic and then punish themselves afterwords.  Priceless.



Notes regarding scroll 1 – Hybrid of Elves and Seelie Fae – Code name Shikari

This mixing has created a creature that can't be banished, slept, or charmed, but can use fae curses and both schools of magic with ease.  The interesting part regarding this creature is that it tends to vary from the norms of wild elven.........



This is my last entry.  Reverane is nearing the final stage.  The final items will be left in my lab.  Instructions are below.

**The Malice of Greyhorn** 

Longsword



Detects – Magical, School: Both

Evaluates – 24 copper

Identifies – Magical, School: Both, Damage Aura +1, Rendered Indestructible, Greater Extension, All abilities unlocked by current holder of the weapon.



Innate Magical Abilities -  Damage Aura +1, Rendered Indestructible, Greater Extension

4 Arcane Blight Land at will

5 Immune to Infection/Curse of Transformation

6 Malice's Army – To use this ability the user plants their feet and states the abilities incant.  Following the incant, the user then calls out “Voice Radius Create Undead, Voice Radius Cause Mortal Wounds 40”.  The user will call no effect to all skills used against them while using the two voice radius effects.  Following this, the caster may then cast Magic Help Undead 30 in a storm similar to a magic storm.  If the storm is broken or ended, the user goes to the circle, resurrects, and gains a backlash from the formal chart.  This effect will automatically end after a maximum of one hour, and must end before plot shuts down for the evening.  If the user is undead, the user takes no effect to the ending effect.  The user must be able to speak and have the ability to use game skills to use this ability.  Incant: By my malice I doom my enemies.
