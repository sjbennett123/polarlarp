To hands of his royal highness Prince Kevynn Blackfox Prince of Northmarch and to Sir Tivorak, Knight of Evendarr.

There have arisen several matters, which you need to be aware of and for which I need your guidance and your aid.

All this revolves around the execution of the sentence of permanent death upon one individual known as Diablo Evermore. This sentence was pronounced after I investigated the following crimes.

He has plotted the death of several of Greyhorn's nobles including myself, Baron Chance Evermore, Lady Nyneave Crescenthorn, Viscount Elladon Al' Seer, Lord Connor Whistlethorn and Baron Arcannon Crescenthorn. Said plots resulted from the removal of his title and his desire to gain revenge on those who wronged him. For this I find him guilty of multiple counts of treason.

He participated in the murders, assaults, and robberies of several individuals in Greyhorn during the last gathering of the Fall of 602. Because of this many of these individuals from other lands have publicly vowed never to return to Greyhorn. Again this was a result of the loss of his title and his desire for revenge. For this I find him guilty of multiple counts of murder, assault, and theft.

He has Impersonated a Noble of Evandarr, While waiting to be executed in Aeran’or for the crime of Necromancy Diablo attempted to pass himself off as a Lord of Greyhorn.

He has a pact with a being from a place called the infernal plane. This pact revolves around the bloodlines of various members of the Evermore tribe. This pact requires the member to perform acts that can only be described as self-serving and evil in order to advance in the courts of these beings. I believe this is the source of the difficulties caused by the Evermores in various lands, such Therendry, Dyllaria, and Elysia. In the summer of 602 Stormsport was attacked by an army of sea raiders led by infernal beings. After this attack I made dealing with infernal beings an equivalent crime to necromancy. Later while I was preparing the formal edict against Diablo Evermore I found out about his ties to these beings and therefore find him guilty for which the penalty is one death.

In my presence he has attempted to manipulate his leader Lasadar to ask me for the power to kill anybody who leaves the Evermores. During my whole conversation with Lasadar, Diablo was literally whispering in Lasadar's ear. I refused this request as it constituted slavery and reminded them they had signed a treaty with Greyhorn that recognized the right of any member of their tribe to leave. Later I found out he continued to make these threats to his fellow Evermores. For this I find him guilty of slavery.

 Since the removal of his title, I have received several pieces of information to indicate that he was arming himself with necromantic items of great powers. I was not able to confirm this as he fled Greyhorn before the next gathering. Later he was found with a necromantic shield in Aeran'or and was executed for it in Aeran'or confirming the reports I have.

I append a copy of the formal edict against Diablo in which I ordered his obliteration. Furthermore because of the special circumstances of his being a leader and having commanded in battle I added the provision that if he resisted in any manner I would order his permanent death. After my experiences with Phoenix, Desmond Dark, The Jester's Guild of Tyrra, The Harlequins, Bloodstone Gypsies, and Kysol Azeel, I feel that such individuals are to be hunted down to the ends of Tyrra before they have a chance to inflict their evil in other lands. 

## Course of Events

In the spring of 600 the Evermores leave Elysia and take up residence in Greyhorn. As they are a group whose culture is unlike Evendarr, I made a sovereign treaty with them so we had a formal means of resolving disputes and that they felt they were fairly treated by Greyhorn.

By December of 600 I determined that Diablo Evermore would serve well as my knight. I picked him for his martial ability, his willingness to swear to the code of chivalry, and his willingness to swear to the king. I felt he had proven himself during the incidents with Zameon Evermore where we supported Elysia in outlawing him. He calmed the Evermores, when Zameon was executed in Greyhorn.

In 601 one of my oldest friend Chance Evermore returned from service in the Evendarr Royal Marines. He was one of those who originally adventured with me 9 years ago along with Kyrian Drakemoor. He was one of those who joined the Evermores when they first formed and was blood-bonded as a full member. In addition when Kyrian Drakemoor first became Baron of Meddlar he was appointed a knight of Meddlar. He later left for the Evendarr Royal Marines for a service of four years. When he returned I made him my squire. In January of 602 I appointed Chance as my Baron of the North for his loyal service. Also at the same time I elevated Diablo to Lordship of the Hadran where he was directed to improve that land so it may be turned into a full barony. 

At the March gathering afterward Lasadar confronted me along with Diablo. He wanted the power to kill anybody who leaves the Evermores which I refused to give him as it violated the treaty we signed and it constituted slavery. During this whole time Diablo was supporting Lasadar and whispering in his ear when Lasadar floundered on answering one of my points. I believe now that Diablo was angry with me for appointing Chance over himself for Baron of the North and was trying to consolidate control over the Evermores.

However in late summer of 602, it was reported to me that Lord Diablo slept under the same roof as Ember, a criminal wanted for the murder of 8 individuals in Greyhorn as well as being a known member of the Jester's Guild. In addition he adventured with Ember, and when nobles of Greyhorn attempted to work with the Elysian nobles to have him obliterated, Diablo did not offer his support. He also worked with Elysian nobles opposed to Ember's execution to stop the plans that were already in place. Ember was released into Diablo's custody and escaped during the journey. Later it was found that Diablo also knew that the King had ordered Ember's permanent death for being a member of the Jester's Guild.

To my discredit I was so angered at Diablo I ordered his immediate assassination. However a week later I withdrew the order and apologized to my nobles. Instead I stripped him of his titles and lands in October. I also authorized Viscount Elladon Al'Seer to investigate him for necromancy and dealing with infernal beings giving the authority to levy the punishment of obliteration if needed. However a preponderance of evidence was not established and no sentence was levied. I concurred with Elladon's actions and let the matter drop.

But after the October gathering it was found out that Diablo orchestrated the assault and murder of individuals in Stormsport, many of which were visitors. In addition I became aware of a power struggle within the Evermores as Diablo attempted to extend his control by threatening death to any who defy him. Then by January of 603 I had received information that that Diablo was plotting against various members of the Evandarr Nobility who angered him in the past including myself and Baron Chance. In addition I received more information on the October incidents. Finally by the spring I felt I had a preponderance of evidence to establish guilt and ordered his obliteration.

In the spring of 603 we learned that Diablo had left Greyhorn and entered the Kingdom of Aeran'or. Aeran'or had recently emerged from a war with the undead and were actively encouraging trade with other lands. They were experiencing a massive influx of adventurers seeking their fortune and it was my belief that Diablo was attempting to lose himself in the influx of immigrants and rebuild his power.

I sent several my nobles, including my highest ranks;Baron Christos, Viscount Elladon, and Baron Chance. Our attempts at opening formal relations were frustrated by the continual conflicts in Aeran'or between the nobility and the guilds. Apparently the Guilds of Aeran'or have tremendous power not seen in other lands.

By July of 603 I issued the formal writ against Diablo, and Baron Chance was ordered to go to Aeran'or and to get their nobles to help in obliterating Diablo. Baron Chance also knew that Diablo would possess several necromantic items on his person and was going to give that information to Aeran'or as proof of our claims. 

Baron Chance arrived in Aeran'or in the town of Bluebrook. There he contacted Squire Constance Black and Magistrate Bob the only two noble representatives in the town. They stated that they would contact their liege, Baroness Joesphine. Baron Chance gave them the information on Diablo concerning the necromantic items. They apprehended him and searched him and found a necromantic shield and a charm amulet. For that they executed him by burning him at the stake. During his trial Magistrate Bob presented Diablo with my writ and told him that he was to report to Baron Chance for a obliteration at the July Gathering. In reaction to all this I sent a letter stating I would support them in joining the concordance and that we would try to resolve this matter before returning to Aeran'or. 

Diablo did not show up for obliteration. Nor did we receive any reply throughout the month of July. We kept getting reports that Diablo was arming himself and preparing to attack any citizen of Greyhorn if they enter Aeran'or. The week prior to the august gathering in Aeran'or I ordered Baron Chance into Aeran'or with a picked force of loyal men. My orders were as follows.

*You are to find and kill Diablo until his permanent death. Any members of the Evermore tribe or known allies that stand with Diablo are to be killed. You are to defend yourself against any innocents, or citizens of Aeran'or that attack you. But under no circumstances are you to kill them or to loot them. If you find yourself in a situation where the only way to get Diablo is by killing innocents or citizens of Aeran'or then you are to withdraw and return to Greyhorn. Any violation of these orders will result in the execution of the individual responsible.*

When Baron Chance entered Aeran'or on August 1st he spotted Artanis along with Lasadar, Gehenna, and Scarred all known confederates with Diablo. He attacked Artanis who fled into the woods along with Lasadar and Scarred. Gehenna stayed behind and Baron Chance put a watch on her. Lord Indigo, Viscount Elladon, and Baron Christos arrived and talked to Chance and urged him to resolve the situation quickly. Lord Indigo after examining my writ stated that by her statements on the message trees Gehenna had committed treason and that all supporters of Diablo are to be killed. Baron Chance then orders the execution of Gehenna. Contrary to rumors her body was not mutilated. When Faustus Evermore threatened to mutilate her body to anger those who were hiding in the woods, her body had already dissipated. 

Later three journeymen from Aeran'or's Guilds came and told Baron Chance he was not to leave town. Later Baron Chance spotted Scarred walking with the Journeymen. Baron Chance and his force attacked and killed Scarred before they could hear the journeymen state that that Scarred was under their protection. One of the journeymen attacked and all three journeymen were cut down in the ensuing melee. Baron Chance ordered that they not be killed or looted and withdrew to a distance and watched to make sure they were revived. Also Lord Indigo, who was opposed to Baron Chance's actions, stayed over their bodies as well. Soon afterwards the journeymen returned with a guildmaster and ordered Baron Chance and his men to leave Aeran'or. They gathered their things and left.

The Aeran'or nobles were understandably upset and about a week later we found this missive posted on their message trees.

 

*To All,*

 

*This past gathering, in Wyvern's Watch, many "things" occured that trouble Us greatly. As these actions took place in the Barony of Morraine, We have decided to place Baron Tich'kit in charge of seeing Our will done. As visiting Nobles were involved, We wish this cleared up as soon as possible. We have decided that the newly appointed Dame Constance Black, the Lady of Bluebrook, host a meeting in her town. On the Evening of September the Fifth of this year Baron Tich'Kit will be there, to orchestrate a deal that satisfies Us. We intend for this matter to be handled with out delay, and We know our friends from Greyhorn would like nothing more. Any questions may be directed to either the Good Baron Tich'Kit, or to His Grace Sir Marius Prichard. We have instructed all of Our nobles not to respond to this message on the trees. All communication is to be sent personally and privately. Good Baron Tich'Kit you know Our will, the matter is now in your capable hands.*

 

*In Service to Aeran'or,*

*Her Majesty*

*Dame Katherine Moore*

*Queen of Aeran'or*

 

In addition Baron Chance has received the following missive.

 

*Good Baron Chance,* 

 

*I do apologize for the length of time it has taken me to respond to your earlier missive and I understand your reasoning in sending a second missive to both myself and my liege. I have been asked by His Grace, Sir Marius Pritchard, to inform you that at this time there are no actions pending against you. The purpose of our meeting this coming weekend is to determine the circumstances and events of last month in Wyvern Watch. After the information is reviewed and a recommendation sent to my liege, we hope this matter to be over.* 

 

*Thaddeus Tich'kit* 

*Baron of Morraine*

 

And this missive the night before he arrived:

 

*Good Baron Chance,* 

 

*I wished to inform you that I will be in Bluebrook tomorrow night to meet with you and discuss the events of last month. If you would be so kind as to meet with me around the eleventh hour of the evening to put this matter to rest, I am sure that everyone involved will rest easier.* 

 

*Sincerely,*

*Lord Thaddeus Tich'kit* 

*Baron of Morraine*



Both Baron Chance and myself were supposed to be at the meeting but I was delayed by unexpected flooding of the Hadran due to rains. I found that on the night of September 5th Baron Chance arrived and was arrested for the assault of the three journeymen, and for the death of Scarred and Gehenna. He was tried and found guilty of assault and two counts of murder. His possessions were stripped from him and he was escorted out of Aeran'or. A missive was sent to Prince Kevyn Blackfox outlining Baron Chance's crimes and the Aeran'or nobles gave the right of execution to the Prince as Baron Chance was his vassal. 

## In Closing

I am responsible for all actions taken in this matter to date. At every step of the way I expected reports from my nobles and acted in accordance to what I thought was best in the name of the king and chivalry and ordered them to action based on my judgments. 

I chose Chance Evermore as Baron because he has never betrayed the faith that myself or Kyrian Drakemoor placed in him. His only fault, if it can be called one, is that he is unyielding in his service to chivalry and to the king. However it is this quality and the leadership he has demonstrated to his men that I chose him to pursue Diablo. I knew that out of all those in my service he would be unrelenting in his service. Also out of all my nobles he is the one with sufficient command of his men to ensure that no innocents would be killed or looted during his pursuit of Diablo. At every step of the way he has kept me informed and has followed my every order. 

There is no doubt that Diablo is evil and that given the chance he would cause just as much suffering as Desmond Dark, The Jester's Guild, or Kysol Azeel. I cannot in good faith let the evil of this man be inflicted on an unsuspecting land. The code of chivalry teaches that *Thou shalt perform thy noble duties be they not contrary to the laws of the land.* We have made every endeavor to work with the nobles of Aeran'or. But when faced with the choice of doing nothing in the face of their indifference, I chose to hunt Diablo down like the dog he is. I choose to fight evil without cessation. To be the champion of the right and the good regardless of what land evil is found. I stand in your judgment and await your decision.
