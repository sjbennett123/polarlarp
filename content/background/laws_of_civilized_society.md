title: The Laws of Civilized Society
---

**These are the absolute laws of the land of the Kingdom of Evendarr. Individual Principalities, Duchies, Counties, Baronies, and even Estates may have their own additional laws so long as they do not conflict with any higher law.** **

 These are the expected punishments as accepted by the leaders of the Kingdoms and Empires upon the continent of Avalon upon the world of Tyrra.**

It may be noted that anyone who is foolish enough to merit a third punishment for any crime will find no mercy and receive a punishment consummate with the severity of their crime.

Judgment and sentencing by a Noble or their designee (Magistrate) need not include a trial nor even the presence of the accused, though a trial is encouraged. If a trial is granted, it is the responsibility of the accused to gather any that wish to speak for them. If witnesses are not present at the time of the trial, time will not necessarily be allotted to summon them.

Once sentence has been pronounced, the criminal is often granted a period of time (usually 45 minutes) to gather any fines, surrender to the authorities, or prepare for death. In the event that the criminal cannot pay a fine, he will be required to surrender any property, barring one weapon of the judge's choice, to make up the difference of the fine. If the punishment of a crime includes death, then it is the Noble’s decision as to the manner of death unless the law specifies otherwise. Note, a punishment of Death requires that the spirit dissipates to seek resurrection, not merely existing in the state of death prior to receiving a life spell.

Finally, the Noble may increase or decrease the sentence if they believe it is merited. These cases should be the exception instead of the norm.

If an individual is convicted of a crime, and sentenced to ‘Public Beating”, they will be placed within a circle of the townsfolk, and each is permitted to strike the criminal once.

Traditionally a Noble is tried by their liege lord if such is possible though such a courtesy given to a Noble is not required by law.

To be declared Outlaw is to be stripped of all protections and rights granted under the laws of Evendarr and any additional lower laws. An outlaw must still obey the law and is subject to all strictures and responsibilities of it. If the Outlaw status is made indefinite then it must last at least one year after which time the Outlaw must gain the sponsorship of a Baron to plead his case to at least the Duke of the lands in which the crime was committed in order for the status to be lifted.
