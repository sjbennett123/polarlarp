title: Myrr and the Sarr
---

The Sarr are a felinoid race that live in a country known as Myrr, which is just west of Lake Quentari. They are a bloodthirsty people who prefer swords and other edged weapons to all others. They are primarily carnivorous and will often eat what they have killed in battle, but many Sarr also supplement their diets with fruits, vegetables, and bread.

Sarr are color-blind and have a heightened sense of smell which allows them to detect disease or poison but does not allow them to identify it.

Sarr females come into "heat" once or twice a year; this is the only time of year that they can conceive. Litters usually have two to six children which are physically mature in two years. They are not considered adults until their sixteenth birthday.

Sarr do not marry; they mate for life and even this usually only occurs between two Sarr who are truly committed to one another or for political reasons. Sarr are not often monogamous, but when a female comes into heat it is the responsibility of her family to see that she mates appropriately, if at all.

The society of Myrr is matriarchal, the females outnumbering the males four to one. In Sarr society, females give the family its name as well as being the only members of society able to inherit and/or hold a title. Each clan is ruled by a Grand Matriarch, the eldest female of the eldest family. She is assisted by a council made up of the eldest female from each family. This oldest female holds the title of "Sandaj," a rough translation being "Lady," no matter how rich, poor, old, or young she is. Ladyships are inherited, while the title of "Sangar," or "Dame," is earned. Families within Myrr usually live within a compound of "apartments" where the entire extended family lives. All Sarr of the generation elder than oneself are referred to as mother or father; all Sarr of the same generation are son or daughter.

The family is the most important concept in Sarr culture. The highest form of treason in Myrr is fighting between families, even worse is causing war between two families. Of course, anything goes as long as you don't get caught. Being convicted of such a crime usually means death or banishment.

Sarr do not approve of the use of Celestial Magics; being attuned to the earth, they prefer and understand earth magics much better. Necromancy is the accepted, legal form of battle magic in Myrr. Slavery is also legal in Myrr, although it is much more like indentured servitude. A "slave" in Myrr is treated well, like valuable property, and is given every opportunity to gain or fine tune skills. After a period of five years a slave can buy himself free for the original buying price.

Sarr eat their dead; to not do so would be a waste of perfectly good meat. When a Sarr permanently dies, a "funeral feast" is held, during which the family and friends consume the body.

Sarr do not call themselves Sarr. The word that they use for themselves is "Gorbe." When the Sarr first settled in Myrr, they were met by Quentari Elves. In their first communications the elves asked "What are you?" and pointed at the Sarr. They replied "Sarh," which means "head." The Sarr had misunderstood and thought the elves were pointing at their heads.

There are nine Sarr clans -the big cats: Lion (Shir), Tiger (Nimeshab), Leopard (Palang), Jaguar (Barg), and Puma (Shen); and the small cats: Lynx (Neshan), Cheetah (Sari), Ocelot (Kamar), and Marquay (Darre) Each clan uses a different precious stone or metal fashioned into beads, which are worn in the hair or on the clothes as a clan marker.

Durqai also exports large amounts of silk, spices, and incense. Upon entering Durqai, one finds oneself looking down a long tiled street that ends in a beautiful white building. This is the Promenade and the Gallery. The Promenade is lined with statues of Sarr heroes and the stalls of the marketplace. The mosaics that make up the tiled street tell stories of the war with the Sand Goblins in the Dasht-i-Lut forty years ago. The Gallery is where artworks from all over Myrr are prominently displayed. Behind the Gallery is the Asmara School of Necromancy and Weapon mastery. The current Grand Matriarch’s grandmother founded the Amara School during the Goblin Wars. It is still the leading school of the arts of war in Myrr.

Shiraz:

Shiraz is a town in the Dasht-I-Kavir in northern Myrr. The Ocelot Clan controls the region. Shivraz is where the camels of Myrr are bred and trained. The Ocelot Clan also exports a desert delicacy to the rest of Myrr-the large jumping desert mice that Sarr enjoy so much. Members of the Ocelot Clan are often hired to do jobs involving thievery due to their size and enjoyments of such pursuits. In a way, Shiraz is sister city to the Durqai; they are the only desert cities of Myrr, and while Durqai had the Promenade, Shiraz has the Walk. The Walk is vaguely modeled after the Promenade; the mosaics are parodies of various Sarr myths while the statues are of an erotic nature rather than representing the heroes of Myrr.

 

Grand Matriarch of Shiraz:

Na'in Minab -   This middle aged female has sometimes been acused of using poisons to get what she wants. This may be true, but the Sarr tradition of standing by your Grand Matriarch is too strong to allow anything but occasional grumbling.

Saravan-  The Saravan family breed camels, but it is no secret in Myrr that many members of this family hire out their services as assassins.

 

Qain-    This family has run the Alchemy Guild for many years. For a price, they will teach the recipes of some of the simpler poisons, but they jealously guard the recipes for the more complex elixers.

There are also athletic competitions, dances, dramatic presentations, and grand feasts. During festival week, most of the cities of Myrr appear to be fairly empty. Most cland have traditional places where their tents are raised every festival. During Festival Week, the Grand Matriarchs from the various cities meet to discuss any problems that may have arisen. This is also when many bargaisn are made between families from different cities. Matings are also a popular thing to arrange at the Festival.
