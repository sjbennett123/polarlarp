### Season Pass

Buy ten game days, get two free.  A $360 value for $300. They do not expire if you don't use it all in one year/season. Records are kept at check-in. Purchase this offer with cash or check for $300. PayPal is subject to $12 surcharge, so $312. Webmaster@polarlarp.org is our PayPal address.  Payments can be mailed or meet ups arranged. Pre registration is still required for each event you attend or you will be subject to standard door fee $5/day. If something catastrophic happens, they can be transferred on a case by case basis to another player.  We hope to help save y'all some money and give us a head start for booking great sites and having great event props for 2024 season!
