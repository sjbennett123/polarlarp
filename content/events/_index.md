For this coming event, I am requiring all pc to sleep on the opposite side of the road as the tavern building. The cabins on the tavern side of the road will all be out of game. If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

Any walk-in people at this event, I ask that you print and bring your character sheet with you to the event.
