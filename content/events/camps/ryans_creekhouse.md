Every Tuesday  folks are invited to come sit with us if you want to come hang out and chill.

 Wings (Jumbo or Boneless) are $1 Jumbo and $0.50 Boneless (CHUNKS) and $5 Pitchers of Yueling/Flight/OctoberFest Beer.  They have other food of course but this is the cheap cats meow.

Doors open around 3:30 and we are there to get a table between 3:30-3:45 we just need a number to give them so they will accommodate.

This is a STANDING Invitation.
