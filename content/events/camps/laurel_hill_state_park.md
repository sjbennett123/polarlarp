# **Q: What are the camp site facilities like?**
# A. Cabins are assigned on a first come fist serve basis, except for buildings that are in a specific location In-Game. The cabins are two or four man cabins with beds that are wire springs or plywood boards with **no mattresses**, so please bring bedding. This is a summer camp site so there is no heat! There will only be one electrical outlet and light in each cabin. (Note: Heaters are **not** permitted.) It can get very cold at this site at night, especially during early spring or late fall events. We suggest bringing extra blankets, even if it looks like it will be warm enough. Also, the bathrooms and showers are in their own individual facilities. Please note that our camp site does not allow bird seed packets.
