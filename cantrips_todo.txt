REPLENISH/CORRUPT
Bin’Aven’s Natural Enhancement/Bin’Aven’s
Unnatural Growth
Type: Broad
Duration: Instant
School: Earth
Cost: 2 Components
Incant: By the earth I replenish this land/By chaos I corrupt
this land.
 Effect: Replenish will bring a 10’ by 10’ area per level of
earth formal magic of the caster more in line with the
natural progression in the area. This will undo the effects
of corruption and chaos upon the land in slow increments.
Corruption will cause an area to become more out of line
with the natural flow in an area, impassible thorns and
brambles may grow, fertile areas may become swamp like,
pools of chaos will become more likely to develop. This
will affect a 10’ by 10’ area per level of earth formal magic
of the caster rendering it harder to develop and use. The
caster is the center of this cantrip's effect.
OOG Note: For each level of formal magic of the caster
both dimensions increase by 10’ so someone with 2 levels
has a 20’ x 20’ maximum and someone with 8 levels has an
80’ x 80’ maximum.

elemental <type>“. The elemental chosen may not be
changed without casting another boltstorm. While the
cantrip is in effect, the caster can perform no other skill nor
cast any other spell or cantrip. Each packet thrown acts as
a separate elemental attack doing 10 points of the chosen

the pool is used up. The caster may only have one

throw as 10 elemental <type>. This pool is lost if the caster
dies and requires a life spell. A new casting of Element’s
